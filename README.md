# Nfnaa's space!

Hey! Iâ€™m Na ðŸ‘‹ welcome to nfnaa, my personal portfolio website.
Here youâ€™ll find a collection of my projects, experiments, and ideasâ€”ranging from coding challenges to creative works Iâ€™ve been building along the way.

# A little knowledge:

My project is a personal portfolio website. I made it to showcase who I am, the projects Iâ€™ve been working on, and the ideas Iâ€™m still dreaming of. Itâ€™s not only a place for my code, but also a reflection of my growth, creativity, and the things I want to keep building in the future.

If you ask my reason, itâ€™s always simple.

The reason why I made this project is because I needed a home for my journeyâ€”a space where I can share my experiments, my first steps in web development, and eventually, bigger projects. I was inspired by seeing how other developers present themselves online, and I wanted to create something that felt like me.

As the journal begins, the main struggle was starting from scratch. I just began learning web development a few weeks before, so I had to face the basics head-on: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even trying out frameworks like React. I had to figure out responsive design, layouts that donâ€™t break, and how to make my site look both clean and personal.
